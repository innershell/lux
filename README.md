# Overview
A lightweight, non-destructive photo editing software designed for photography workflows. As a casual photographer, the commercial tools are too expensive for processing only a few photos monthly, but the open source tools were cumbersome to use. So I created a tool for my own use that replicates the workflow and UI/UX of commercial tools.

# Features
1. **Albums**: Organize photos by importing files from various folders to create albums. Quickly rate, tag, label, cull, rotate, and crop photos using keyboard shortcuts. Quickly filter and find your photos using EXIF and other metadata.
2. **Develop**: Achieve unique looks using lens filters and custom adjustments. Compare before/after to achieve that perfect look.
3. **Process**: Bulk process developed photos with additional tools to resize, rename, add watermark, reduce quality, and change image file type.

Supported Platforms

* Microsoft Windows
